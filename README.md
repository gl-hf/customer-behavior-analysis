# Customer Behavior Analysis

End-to-end data analysis project using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior based on a retail dataset with 3,900 transactions.  
The goal is to understand how customers buy, what drives revenue, and how factors like discounts and subscriptions affect spending.


## 📌 Project Goals

- Identify high-value customer segments  
- Analyze revenue and sales by product category  
- Evaluate the impact of discounts and subscriptions  
- Explore customer behavior across age groups  
- Build a business-oriented dashboard for decision support  


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** — data cleaning, preprocessing, basic feature engineering  
- **PostgreSQL / SQL** — analytical queries, aggregations, CTEs  
- **Power BI** — interactive dashboard and KPI visualization  
- **Git** — version control and project structure

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to visualize:

- KPIs:  
  - Number of Customers  
  - Average Purchase Amount  
  - Average Review Rating  
  - Subscription Rate  
- Revenue by category  
- Revenue by age group  
- Customer distribution by subscription status
